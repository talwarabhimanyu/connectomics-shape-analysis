      <h1>3D Shape Analysis for Connectomics</h1>

      <p style="font-family:times;">During the Spring semester of 2019, I had the opportunity to work on a research project with Prof. Hanspeter Pfister's <a href="https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu">Visual Computing Group</a> at Harvard, under the guidance of Donglai Wei and Zudi Lin. Our work involves analysis of 3D models of cellular organelles (such as neurons) inside the brain, with the aim of explaining the variance in their shapes. </p> 
      
      <p style="font-family:times;"> Our work answers questions such as: How many types of organelle shapes exist? Can all these shapes be decomposed into simpler primitives? Towards that end, we developed a simple shape descriptor, which provides an intuitive picture of complex 3D shapes, and at the same time preserves adequate topological details to be used for shape sensitive tasks such as shape matching and retrieval. We have submitted our work to a peer reviewed conference and are awaiting feedback. </p>

<h2 id="background">Background & Big-Picture Objective</h2>
<p style="font-family:times;"> Connectomics is defined by Wikipedia as:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p style="font-family:times;"> ... the production and study of connectomes: comprehensive maps of connections within an organism's nervous system, typically its brain or eye. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family:times;"> Connectomics is now done at nano-scale resolution, i.e. we can tell apart two points of an organelle which are just a few nanometers (nm) apart. For this project I dealt with typical resolutions of 60nm. One implication of the availability of such high resolution data is that we can now observe never-seen-before details of organelle. Below are two examples of such rich 3D models. </p>

</figure>

<p style="font-family:times;"> Given these types of complex 3D shapes, our big picture goal is to come up with a shape descriptor which captures the essential features of a shape (such as connectivity between two points on the shape, length of paths between two points, loops etc.) and discards non-essential features (such as spines on a neuron's dendrites, loops with a tiny circumference in mitochondria). </p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem Statement</h2>
<p style="font-family:times;"> The aim is twofolds: </p>
<ul>
	<li style="font-family:times;">Propose a shape descriptor which captures essential topological details of a shape and discards non-essential features.</li>
	<li style="font-family:times;">Propose a method to extract that descriptor for two datasets comprised of 3D models of mitochondria and pyramidal neurons.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solution">Proposed Solution & My Contribution</h2>
<p style="font-family:times;"> The figure below shows the pipeline developed by our team, in which we start with a 3D voxelized model of an organelle ("3D Shape" in the figure), extract its shape descriptor (the "Reduced Graph"), and propose a nomenclature scheme for naming such Reduced Graphs (the "Topological Nomenclature"). My contribution to this pipeline has been the algorithm for extracting Reduced Graph representation from the Skeleton representation).</p>

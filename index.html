      <h1>3D Shape Analysis for Connectomics</h1>
      <p style="font-family:times;"> Connectomics has been <a href="https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/publications/the-big-data-challenges-of-connectomics/paper">described</a> by Profs. Licthman, Pfister, and Shavit as the field concerned with mapping networks of interconnected cells inside a nervous system, at the synaptic level. The field has seen a surge in the amount of available data with advances in electron microscopy producing detail rich 3D models of cellular organelle like neurons. During Spring 2019, I had the fortune to work with such exciting data at Prof. Hanspeter Pfister's lab, the <a href="https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu">Visual Computing Group</a> at Harvard. My project focused on nano-scale resolution 3D models of mitochondria and pyramidal neurons and attempted to make a tiny contribution towards shape analysis of these organelle. I'm grateful to my advisors <a href="https://donglaiw.github.io/">Donglai Wei</a> and Zudi Lin for giving me the opportuntiy to work on this project, and for their guidance and patience throughout the project.

      <p style="font-family:times;">Our work involves analysis of 3D models of cellular organelles (such as neurons) inside the brain, with the aim of explaining the variance in their shapes. We attempt to answer questions such as: How many types of organelle shapes exist? Can all these shapes be decomposed into simpler primitives? Once we have a grasp over the shape-universe of these organelle, the next step would be to understand how different shapes relate to biological functions. </p>
      
      <p style="font-family:times;"> Towards that end, we have developed a simple shape descriptor called the "Reduced Graph", which provides an intuitive picture of complex 3D shapes, and at the same time preserves adequate topological details to be used for shape sensitive tasks such as shape matching and retrieval. We have submitted our work to a peer reviewed conference and are awaiting feedback. </p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p style="font-family:times;"> Connectomics is defined by Wikipedia as:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p style="font-family:times;"> ... the production and study of connectomes: comprehensive maps of connections within an organism's nervous system, typically its brain or eye. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family:times;"> Connectomics is now done at nano-scale resolution, i.e. we can tell apart two points of an organelle which are just a few nanometers (nm) apart. For this project I dealt with typical resolutions of 60nm. One implication of the availability of such high resolution data is that we can now observe never-seen-before details of organelle. Below are two examples of such rich 3D models. </p>

</figure>

<p style="font-family:times;"> Given these types of complex 3D shapes, our big picture goal is to come up with a shape descriptor which captures the essential features of a shape (such as connectivity between two points on the shape, length of paths between two points, loops etc.) and discards non-essential features (such as spines on a neuron's dendrites, loops with a tiny circumference in mitochondria). </p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem Statement</h2>
<p style="font-family:times;"> The aim is twofolds: </p>
<ul>
	<li style="font-family:times;">Propose a shape descriptor which captures essential topological details of a shape and discards non-essential features.</li>
	<li style="font-family:times;">Propose a method to extract that descriptor for two datasets comprised of 3D models of mitochondria and pyramidal neurons.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solution">Proposed Solution & My Contribution</h2>
<p style="font-family:times;"> The figure below shows the pipeline developed by our team, in which we start with a 3D voxelized model of an organelle ("3D Shape" in the figure), extract its shape descriptor (the "Reduced Graph"), and propose a nomenclature scheme for naming such Reduced Graphs (the "Topological Nomenclature"). My contribution to this pipeline has been designing and implementing the Graph Reduction algorithm.</p>

<p style="font-family:times;"> Before settling on the Reduced Graph shape descriptor, I tried some existing approaches, which can be seen here: <a href="/connectomics-shape-analysis/other-descriptors.html">[Heat Kernel Signature]</a>.
